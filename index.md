### About me
I am interested in the application of computer vision and machine learning for robotic systems. My previous work has focused on perception for navigation and perception for interaction e.g. affordance perception.

I did my PhD at [The Visual Information Lab](https://vilab.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/) of the University of Bristol, where I was advised by [Walterio Mayol-Cuevas](http://people.cs.bris.ac.uk/~wmayol). Prior to that, I coursed the MSc in Machine Learning, Data Mining and High Performance Computing also at the University of Bristol. I did my bachelor in Mechatronics Engineering at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.

I currently work doing vision for underwater robots at [Rovco](https://www.rovco.com/)

#### Current Work

*   Something with AUVs but confidential
*   Something cool with ROVs but classified
*   Something else with vision but off the record
